There is much information on the Internet about the Markdown language, but you should find all you need for this course on this one webpage: [GitHub Markdown Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Important: Learning to use Markdown and Jekyll could well be the topic of a complete course, but in this course, you do NOT need to know much about Markdown programming. Please use only the basics shown in this module instead of more advanced features, and do not worry about getting the format perfect!
